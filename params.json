This is xmbd.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more: xmbd not only gives you this abilities for - say - YouTube, no the things provided here are for everyone!\r\n\r\n**Currently supported Providers** are:\r\n- YouTube\r\n- Vimeo\r\n- Dailymotion\r\n\r\nand more to come!\r\n\r\nIncluding a media-object is now as simple as `$('#someid').xmbd().embed('vimeo', '75320274')`\r\n\r\nYou can install xmbd via bower:  \r\n`bower install xmbd`\r\n\r\nDependencies are:\r\n- jQuery\r\n- [swfobject](https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/) (for flash-stuff)\r\n\r\nSee the **[README](https://github.com/screeny05/xmbd/blob/master/README.md)** for further details.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n- You can find an Example which implements a small playlist [here on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/KtUH6/3/).\r\n- Take a look at the examples-folder\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nTo build xmbd by yourself follow these commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm install grunt-cli -g\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\nA minified version of xmbd is now in the build-folder!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
